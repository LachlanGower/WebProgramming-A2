					<span>How We Farm</span>
					<div> We fused the Adam producing slug to the stomach lining of the sisters, here the slugs create a symbiotic bond with the children and use the child's resources to excrete ADAM, ADAM is then taken from the child and used to create the genetic wonders you see around you!
					</div>

				<section>
					<span>How We Gather</span>
					<div>The Little Sisters are bonded with a Big Daddy. They are both genetically modified to stop Bad people from hurting them. Fire will not harm the sisters, knives will not harm the sisters, bullets wil not harm the sisters. Upon the deaths of the citizens of Rapture who have used ADAM our little sisters will use a specialised needle to extract ADAM from their corpse. This is all done under the supervision of the Big Daddy.

						Do not get between the Big Daddy and his Little Sister

				<section>
					<span>How We Sell</span>		<div>We sell our products online as needles and drinks.  The needles are very cheap and require a binding  agent called EVE, which is available through a subscription fee. The drinks (Vigors) are very expensive but  don't require an ADAM mold. The binding agent for the Vigors, called Salts are extremely  cheap and do not run dry thus we bulk sell them.
